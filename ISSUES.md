1. After completing build steps and opening Android Studio, there's following build error in AS: 
```org.gradle.api.plugins.UnknownPluginException: Plugin with id 'kotlin-android' not found.```

Tried this fix but no luck: https://superuser.com/questions/1473948/i-am-getting-this-error-in-my-android-studio-plugin-with-id-kotlin-not-found
